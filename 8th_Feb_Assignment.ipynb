        "Abstraction in object-oriented programming (OOP) is the process of hiding implementation details and providing a simpler and more general interface for users to interact with.

They do not need to know how the engine, transmission, or brakes work. These details are hidden from the user, and they only interact with the car through a simpler interface, such as a steering wheel, pedals, and switches.\n",

By using abstraction, the car class can be used by many different users without requiring them to have specialized knowledge of how the car works. This makes the code more modular, easier to understand, and less prone to errors."
