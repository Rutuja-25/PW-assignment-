        "Advantages:\n",
        "1. **Improved Performance**: Multithreading can improve the performance of programs by allowing multiple threads to execute concurrently on a single processor. This can lead to faster response times, better throughput, and increased efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Better Resource Utilization**: Multithreading can make better use of system resources by allowing threads to execute concurrently and share resources such as memory and CPU time. This can reduce the amount of wasted resources and improve the overall efficiency of the system.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Simpler Program Design**: Multithreading can simplify program design by allowing developers to break complex tasks into smaller, more manageable threads. This can make it easier to develop and maintain complex programs, and can lead to more modular and reusable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Disadvantages:\n",
        "1. **Increased Complexity**: Multithreading can add complexity to program design, as developers must ensure that threads are synchronized and that shared resources are accessed safely. This can make debugging and testing more difficult, and can increase the risk of errors and bugs.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Concurrency Issues**: Multithreading can lead to concurrency issues such as race conditions, deadlocks, and thread starvation. These issues can be difficult to detect and debug, and can lead to unpredictable behavior and performance problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Compatibility Issues**: Multithreading can be difficult to implement on some platforms and may not be supported by all systems or libraries. This can limit the portability of programs and increase the risk of compatibility issues."

        "Deadlock: A deadlock is a situation where two or more threads are blocked, waiting for each other to release resources that they need to proceed. In other words, each thread is waiting for a resource that is held by another thread, resulting in a circular waiting pattern that can prevent any of the threads from making progress. Deadlocks can occur when threads are not synchronized properly and can lead to program crashes or hangs.\n",

If T1 acquires R1 and then waits for R2, while T2 acquires R2 and then waits for R1, a deadlock will occur. Neither thread can proceed, as they are waiting for the other thread to release the resource they need.\n",
        "\n",
        "Race Condition: A race condition occurs when two or more threads access a shared resource or variable concurrently, and the final outcome depends on the order in which the threads execute. In other words, the result of the program is dependent on the relative timing of the threads, and the behavior of the program can be unpredictable. Race conditions can lead to bugs or incorrect behavior in multithreaded programs.\n",

        "For example, consider two threads, T1 and T2, that access a shared variable x. If T1 reads the value of x and increments it, while T2 reads the value of x and decrements it, the final value of x will depend on the order in which the threads execute. If T1 executes first, the value of x will be incremented, and if T2 executes first, the value of x will be decremented. This can lead to incorrect behavior if the program relies on a specific value of x.\n",
