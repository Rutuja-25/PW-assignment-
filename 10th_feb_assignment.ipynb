        "'w' (write mode): This mode is used to open a file for writing. If the file does not exist, it is created. If it already exists, its contents are erased before any new data is written to it.\n",
        "\n",
        "'a' (append mode): This mode is used to open a file for appending. If the file does not exist, it is created. If it already exists, new data is written to the end of the file without erasing its existing contents.\n",

        "'x' (exclusive creation mode): This mode is used to create a new file, but raises an error if the file already exists.\n",
